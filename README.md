## About

This is a browser-based implementation of the classic Tetris game, which I used to enjoy playing on my Game Boy growing up. The core gameplay is simple but it also provides various challenging mechanics, which made it the perfect choice for a fun and technically stimulating project.

The aim of this project is not only to recreate the nostalgia but also to offer more complexity by implementing the features and mechanics of Modern Tetris based on the Tetris Guideline as much as possible.
